## Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Contraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
* -1000 <= TreeNode value <= 1000

```
LevelOrder returns List
Parameters are root
LevelOrder prints out the level order of a BST

Method:
    Initalize a list for lists of integers called result
    If root is null return result
    Create a new queue
    add the root the queue
    while the queue isn't empty
        initialize a varaible to hold queue size
        create a list to hold the current level
        for loop for "queue size" amount of times
            Poll the current queue into a treenode
            add the treenode to the list of current level
            repeast for node to the left and right if they aren't null
        add the list of current level to the overall list
    return result.
