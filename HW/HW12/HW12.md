## There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes. For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes where each pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs. Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.


Contraints:

* 2 <= n <= 104
* wells.length == n
* 0 <= wells[i] <= 105
* 1 <= pipes.length <= 104
* pipes[j].length == 3
* 1 <= house1j, house2j <= n
* 0 <= costj <= 105
* house1j != house2j

```
findSet returns int
Parameter target, setList
findSet finds which set the target is located in, in this case the house
Method:
    for all Arraylists of sets in setList
        for all arrays of sets in sets
            for all numbers in arrays of sets
                if target = number
                    return index


minCostToSupplyWater returns int
Parameters are houses, wells, pipes
LevelOrder finds the minimum cost to connect all houses to a supply of water using Kruskul's Algorithm 
Method:
    initialize an Arraylist of arrays of ints called edges
    initialize an Arraylist of Arraylists of arrays if ints called sets
    initialize an integer called cost to 0

    add all of the edges of the house (wells and pipes) to the Arraylist

    Sort the arraylist from least to greatest

    for all arrays of ints in edges
        initialize a variable a to house 1
        initialize a variable b to house 2
        find the setindex of both

        if both houses are in arraylist sets
            merge the sets and add the connection to cost

        else if both houses are not in arraylist sets
            add the connection into the arraylist and add the connection to cost

        else if first house is present in sets and second house isn't
            add the connection into the arraylist that contains that connection with the first house and add the connection to cost

        else if first house isn'y present in sets and second house is
            add the connection into the arraylist that contains that connection with the second house and add the connection to cost

        if the size of sets is equal to 1 and the first index of sets is equal to the number of houses
            break out of the loop

    return cost
